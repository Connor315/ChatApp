### Objective and Key Features

The objective of this project is to design and implement a Real-Time Chat Application in Rust that prioritize performance and reliability. This application will provide an efficient and secure platform for users to create and join chat rooms, communicate in real time, and see each other’s online presence. Key features will include:

1. **User Authentication**: Using the Rocket framework for the backend, we will implement a secure authentication system to manage user sessions and ensure data protection. Rocket’s intuitive routing and type safety will allow us to build robust user management features, facilitating secure login and access control.
2. **Chat Room Creation and Joining**: Users will be able to create or join chat rooms. Rocket will handle room management on the backend, storing room data and managing user associations. This feature will allow interaction between users in different chat rooms and even support group or individual conversations.
3. **Real-Time Messaging**: WebSocket will be used for real-time messaging, enabling low-latency communication between users. By establishing a persistent WebSocket connection, the application will facilitate instant message delivery without the overhead of frequent HTTP requests. We will leverage Rust’s async/await syntax with WebSocket to achieve non-blocking message handling, ensuring efficient performance as the number of users scales.
4. **Presence Detection**: The system will detect and display users’ online/offline status, enhancing the real-time experience and sense of connectivity within chat rooms. This will be managed through WebSocket connections that maintain the state of each user’s presence in real-time. Rust’s concurrency model will allow us to handle multiple connections reliably, keeping presence information up-to-date.
5. **User Interface**: For user interaction, we will develop a lightweight front-end using Yew, a Rust-based framework for building web applications. Yew will allow us to create an interactive web-based interface with real-time features, showcasing Rust’s potential for frontend development as well.

Our Real-Time Chat Application fills a gap in the Rust ecosystem by providing a complete real-time chat solution that’s built entirely with Rust. Currently, there aren’t many complete options in Rust for building chat apps that include secure user authentication, quick messaging, and a user-friendly interface. By using several Rust frameworks and libraries like Rocket for secure backend functions, WebSocket for quick, real-time messaging, and Yew for the user interface, we’re showing that Rust can be used to make responsive and interactive applications.

### Tentative Plan

Our group consists of three members: Chen Wang, Yalin Tuo, and Kangzhi Gao. To successfully deliver the Real-Time Chat Application within a matter of weeks, we have divided the project tasks into four main sections: backend development, real-time chat implementation, frontend development, and presence detection implementation. Here’s our tentative plan for task assignments in each section:

#### Backend Development
- **Set Up the Backend Framework using Rocket (Yalin Tuo & Kangzhi Gao)**: Yalin and Kangzhi will initiate the project by configuring the Rocket framework. This step will lay the foundation for all backend functionalities including routes, middleware, and database connections.
- **User Authentication Implementation (Kangzhi Gao & Chen Wang)**: Concurrently, Kangzhi and Chen will develop a secure authentication system to manage user logins and sessions. This system is crucial for protecting user data and ensuring that only authorized users can access the chat functionalities.

#### Real-Time Chat Implementation
- **WebSocket (Kangzhi Gao & Chen Wang)**: This team will implement WebSocket technology to facilitate real-time messaging. Their focus will be on achieving low-latency communication, which is essential for the seamless exchange of messages in the chat application.
- **Chat Room Creation and Joining (Kangzhi Gao & Chen Wang)**: Alongside WebSocket implementation, they will also develop the features that allow users to create and join chat rooms. This includes handling data structures and server-side logic to manage multiple chat rooms and user interactions within them.

#### Frontend Development
- **Design and Implement the User Interface using Yew (Yalin Tuo & Kangzhi Gao)**: The frontend will be crafted using the Yew framework, focusing on creating a user-friendly and responsive design. Yalin and Kangzhi will ensure that the interface is intuitive and effectively communicates with the backend.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration (Yalin Tuo & Kangzhi Gao)**: This task involves integrating the frontend with the backend services to ensure smooth data flow and functionality across the platform.
- **User Interaction Workflows (Chen Wang & Yalin Tuo)**: Chen and Yalin will map out and implement the interactive elements of the application, ensuring that user actions on the frontend trigger the appropriate responses and data updates from the backend.

#### Presence Detection Implementation
- **Online Status Tracking (Chen Wang & Yalin Tuo)**: This feature will allow the app to show whether users are online or offline. Chen and Yalin will handle the detection and update of user presence status in real-time.
- **Integrate Presence System with Backend and Frontend (Chen Wang & Yalin Tuo)**: They will also ensure that the presence system is fully integrated with both the backend logic and the frontend display, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.

#### Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Functional and Performance Testing (All Members)**: Throughout the development process, all team members will continuously test the application for functionality and performance. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and stress testing to ensure the application is robust, secure, and performs well under load.

By dividing these tasks among our team based on expertise and project needs, we are confident in our ability to efficiently develop and deliver a high-quality, real-time chat application within the projected timeline.
