### Objective and Key Features

The objective of this project is to design and implement a Real-Time Chat Application in Rust, providing an efficient and secure platform for users to create and join chat rooms, communicate in real time, and see each other’s online presence. Key features will include:

1. **User Authentication**: Using the Rocket framework for the backend, we will implement a secure authentication system to manage user sessions and ensure data protection. Rocket’s intuitive routing and type safety will allow us to build robust user management features, facilitating secure login and access control.
2. **Chat Room Joining**: Users will be able to create or join chat rooms. Rocket will handle room management on the backend, storing room data and managing user associations. This feature will allow interaction between users in different chat rooms and even support group or individual conversations.
3. **Real-Time Messaging**: WebSocket will be used for real-time messaging, enabling low-latency communication between users. By establishing a persistent WebSocket connection, the application will facilitate instant message delivery without the overhead of frequent HTTP requests. We will leverage Rust’s async/await syntax with WebSocket to achieve non-blocking message handling, ensuring efficient performance as the number of users scales.
4. **Presence Detection**: The system will detect and display users’ online/offline status, enhancing the real-time experience and sense of connectivity within chat rooms. This will be managed through WebSocket connections that maintain the state of each user’s presence in real-time. Rust’s concurrency model will allow us to handle multiple connections reliably, keeping presence information up-to-date.
5. **Command-Line and Optional Web-Based Interface**: For user interaction, we will develop a command-line interface for simplicity and easy accessibility. Additionally, we may incorporate a lightweight front-end using Yew, a Rust-based framework for building web applications. Yew will allow us to create an interactive web-based interface with real-time features, showcasing Rust’s potential for frontend development as well.

This project combines Rocket for a secure and efficient backend, WebSocket for high-performance, real-time messaging, and Yew for an optional interactive front-end. Our approach demonstrates Rust’s capability to build scalable, real-time applications that prioritize performance and reliability.
